# Space Complexity Report 

## English

### Overview
This repository contains a detailed report on **Space Complexity**, its components, analysis methods, and optimization techniques.  
The report includes:
- **Definition and components** of space complexity.
- **Worked examples** (e.g., summing an array using recursion).
- **Methods to reduce memory usage**, such as in-place algorithms, optimized data structures (e.g., sparse matrices), dynamic programming optimizations, and streaming algorithms.
- **Visual explanations** and tables for better understanding.

### Contents
- `report.tex` – The LaTeX source of the full report.
- `report.pdf` – Compiled PDF of the report.
- `images/` – Supporting images (e.g., stack growth, streaming algorithms).
- `animations/` – GIF animations for visual explanation (e.g., QuickSort process).

### How to Use
